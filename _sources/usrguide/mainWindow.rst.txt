Main window
-----------

Upon opening madgui the programm will display two windows. The first one
is the main window, the second one will show the modeled lattice.

From the main window the user will be able to reach most of the
functionability of madgui. As usual you will see at the top a menu bar,
with following choices
   
   - :doc:`model`
   - :doc:`view`
   - :doc:`exportImport`
   - :doc:`settings`
   - :doc:`online`
   - :doc:`help`
    
On the bottom you will see 4 check boxes and a small menu.
The filter check box is a great tool to help you see the status of the program.
The user would be interested mostly just on the **INFO** option, whereas the developer
might find more handy the options **DEBUG**, **WARNING**, **ERROR** and **CRITICAL**.
Clicking on the **MADX** check boxes will allow you to display the input commands and the
output of the programm. Lastly the time check box displays the time at which the command or
output took place.

One feature the user might find practical, are the arrows in the left side of the main window,
with which the input command history can be executed again.
