Model
=====

When clicking on model, you will be able to see the following options:

  - Open
  - Initial conditions
  - Execute MADX File
  - Reverse sequence
  - Quit

The **Open** and **Execute MADX File** will open a dialog, where you can search for your
model or MADX File.

The **Reverse sequence** and **Quit** options must be self-explanatory.

On the other hand the **Initial conditions** option may deserve a quick introduction.
When clicking on this particular option a dialog window will open up. All the important
parameters that define the initial conditions will be displayed in 3 different groups
and one diagram:

 - Twiss
 - Beam
 - Globals
 - Ellipse

You will recognize the parameters. Just double click on them to change their value,
either by typing on your keyboard or using the arrows.
The ellipse option will show the initial phase-space ellipse in the x-px and y-py spaces.
