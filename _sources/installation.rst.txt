Installation
############

For the more Linux acquainted user, the easiest way to install the package
is with pip. Type in the console the following command and you should be good
to go::

    pip install madgui

If this fails or if you plan to work on the madgui code, please take a look
at the `Developer's Guide`_.

For the Windows user, we prepared a ready to go executable (.exe) that
you can download on `madgui Installer`_.
Note that this is a static release. Updates won't be available and you
will have to take care of the installation of the upcoming new versions.

For this reason we recommend to install madgui through Conda. Please set
up either Miniconda_ or Anaconda_ in your computer and type in the
conda-prompt::

    pip install madgui
