      conversion

0.0.1
-----
Date: 30.11.2017

First reference point to define somewhat stable versions.

List of features:

- cpymad/pytao as simulation backends
- plots: alfa/beta/envelope/orbit; and the ones defined by tao
- integrated python shell (ipython/jupyter) not very useful as of yet:
  limited exhibition of objects, no convenient APIs provided (plotting)
- log tab that shows madx/tao output
- tab that shows madx/tao commands
- display and edit box for beam parameters; initial conditions (i.e. twiss);
  and element attributes (read-only so far)
- 2D floor plan
- matching (interactive + dialog)
- emittance (dialog)
- orbit alignment: 2-grid + N+optic methods
